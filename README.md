# VBA-Scripting
*/ This is a read me file; this VBA-Scripting project is the an excel 
// workbook that takes various logistics information from pallet 
// tags and various discoverer reports (i.e. holds, expected receipts,
// thaw reports for fruit, etc) My hope is find a way to extract this 
// information automatically into this workbook and in combination with 
// the pallet tag information project a tabulation load planning report to
// be used in conjunction with JDA.
